/**
 * claude-model-options.ts — shared model-option sanitizer for Claude models.
 *
 * The Claude Agent SDK path (claude-client.ts) and the native/AI-SDK path
 * (agent-loop.ts) both assemble thinking / effort / context1m options for
 * Anthropic requests. Without a shared sanitizer, breaking-change guards
 * have to be duplicated across paths and drift (which is exactly what Codex
 * flagged in the Opus 4.7 review).
 *
 * Scope for the adaptive-thinking family (Opus 4.7, 4.8, and 5; Fable 5; and
 * Sonnet 5, per the official migration guides — they share the same request
 * contract; Fable 5 additionally cannot turn thinking off AT ALL — adaptive
 * thinking runs even when the param is omitted; see FABLE_PATTERN note below.
 * Sonnet 5 is the opposite on that one axis — thinking CAN be turned off, see
 * SONNET_5_PATTERN note):
 *   - These models do NOT accept manual extended thinking
 *     ({ type: 'enabled', budgetTokens }) — returns 400. Convert to adaptive.
 *   - They support adaptive thinking + effort-based reasoning budget.
 *     (Display=summarized can be added by callers separately.)
 *   - 1M context is the default — context-1m-2025-08-07 beta header is
 *     unnecessary and gets skipped.
 *   - Non-default sampling params (temperature / top_p / top_k) 400 on the
 *     adaptive family (official Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 docs). CodePilot's current
 *     callers don't assemble sampling params for Anthropic requests (grep:
 *     agent-loop.ts / claude-client.ts carry no temperature / topP / topK), but
 *     "safe by construction" is one refactor away from a silent 400. So this
 *     sanitizer now ACTIVELY enforces the contract: pass any temperature/topP/
 *     topK you have through the input, and for the adaptive family non-default
 *     values are stripped from `sampling` and their names reported in
 *     `strippedSamplingParams` so the caller can tell the user (same
 *     surface-don't-swallow rule as `thinkingForcedOn`). Non-adaptive models
 *     (e.g. Sonnet 4.6) pass sampling through untouched — the guard must not
 *     misfire on them. "Default" = temperature omitted or exactly 1 (Anthropic's
 *     default); topP / topK have no default, so ANY explicit value is
 *     non-default and stripped for the adaptive family.
 *   - Sonnet 5 ships a new tokenizer: the same text counts ≈ +30% tokens vs
 *     Sonnet 4.6. This does NOT change request shape, but char-based token
 *     budget estimates (model-context.ts fallback window) under-count on it —
 *     prefer SDK / upstream-reported usage. (Note carried in model-context.ts.)
 *
 * NOTE on effort DEFAULT (4.7 → xhigh, 4.8 → high): per-model defaults remain
 * owned by the Claude Code CLI / SDK when `effort` is left unset. The sole
 * exception is Opus 5 + explicit thinking off: Auto is pinned to the documented
 * compatible High tier so a mutable Runtime default cannot create a 400. That
 * synthesized value carries `effortProvenance: compatibility-default`.

//                               `-5[1m]`) where a non-digit follows.
// Two-part versions additionally require the `-`/`.` separator: without it,
// `opus-4[78]` also claims `claude-opus-48`, another unknown-ID false positive.

// ── Anthropic API effort support (per-model allowlist) ──────────
//
// SEPARATE AXIS from the adaptive-thinking family above. `output_config.effort`
// is only accepted by the models Anthropic lists as effort-capable
// (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort, verified
// 2026-07-18); sending it to any other model is not a supported request shape.
// The two sets happen to coincide today, but they answer different questions
// ("does manual extended thinking 400?" vs "does the API accept effort?"), so
// they stay independent — a future model could support effort without the
// adaptive-thinking contract, or vice versa.
//
// NOT derived from catalog `capabilities.supportedEffortLevels`: that flag is
// the UI picker / Claude Code CLI (SDK runtime) capability, which is a broader
// set — e.g. first-party `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` declares
// supportedEffortLevels ['low','medium','high'] there while the Anthropic API's
// effort list does NOT include Haiku 4.5. Gating the native wire on the catalog
// would keep sending effort to models the API doesn't accept it on (the exact
// regression Codex reproduced: haiku 4.5 + max reached the wire as
// {"effort":"max"}).
//
// Each entry carries the official breadcrumb it was sourced from. Add a model
// here ONLY after confirming it on Anthropic's effort docs — not by inferring
// from a version-number pattern.
//
// This is deliberately a MODEL × LEVEL table. The catalog still drives the
// normal composer picker, but request boundaries cannot trust UI reachability:
// Codex can supply `model_reasoning_effort` from its own config. Sonnet 4.6 is
// the important counterexample — it accepts effort but not `xhigh`. Keeping
// exact levels here lets the official Anthropic wire fail closed instead of
// forwarding an unsupported tier and relying on a 400.
//
// Patterns are bounded the same way as the family patterns above — `sonnet-?4`
// without `(?![0-9])` would claim `claude-sonnet-40`, and unknown IDs must fail
// closed to "effort not supported" rather than inherit a neighbour's contract.
