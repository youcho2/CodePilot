/**
 * claude-model-options.ts — shared model-option sanitizer for Claude models.
 *
 * The Claude Agent SDK path (claude-client.ts) and the native/AI-SDK path
 * (agent-loop.ts) both assemble thinking / effort / context1m options for
 * Anthropic requests. Without a shared sanitizer, breaking-change guards
 * have to be duplicated across paths and drift (which is exactly what Codex
 * flagged in the Opus 4.7 review).
 *
 * Scope for the Opus 4.7+ adaptive-thinking family (4.7, 4.8, and Fable 5,
 * per the official migration guides — they share the same request contract;
 * Fable 5 additionally cannot turn thinking off AT ALL — adaptive thinking
 * runs even when the param is omitted; see FABLE_PATTERN note below):
 *   - These models do NOT accept manual extended thinking
 *     ({ type: 'enabled', budgetTokens }) — returns 400. Convert to adaptive.
 *   - They support adaptive thinking + effort-based reasoning budget.
 *     (Display=summarized can be added by callers separately.)
 *   - 1M context is the default — context-1m-2025-08-07 beta header is
 *     unnecessary and gets skipped.
 *
 * NOTE on effort DEFAULT (4.7 → xhigh, 4.8 → high): that per-model default
 * is applied by the Claude Code CLI / SDK when `effort` is left unset (see
 * claude-client.ts ~1193), NOT here. This sanitizer only normalizes thinking
 * + the context-1m beta; it passes `effort` through untouched.
