/**
 * Inline-html srcDoc Content-Security-Policy injection — Phase 4 P1.2.
 *
 * Background: the `/api/files/html-preview` route applies a strict
 * Round 4 CSP at the HTTP-response level. That CSP protects file
 * previews loaded via the route, but NOT inline-html artifacts
 * produced from chat code fences, the Markdown→HTML presentation
 * pipeline, or the localhost-artifact redirector — those all flow
 * through `<iframe srcDoc=...>` which is sandboxed but otherwise
 * unconstrained, so a script in the rendered content could leak via
 * URL-shaped channels (img / style / script src + query string).
 *
 * This module injects an equivalent CSP as a `<meta>` element near
 * the top of the HTML document. Browsers respect meta CSP for
 * fetch-directives once they encounter the tag in <head>, so
 * inserting BEFORE any other <head> content gives us protection over
 * subsequent subresource loads.
 *
 * Two modes mirror the route:
 *   - 'strict'   : the default. Round 4 Static policy — no scripts,
 *                  no egress (connect/frame/object/worker), https
 *                  allowed only for static-display resources
 *                  (img / style / font / media).
 *   - 'navigate' : permits same-document navigation via meta refresh
 *                  but keeps everything else closed. Used by the
 *                  localhost-artifact path which navigates the
 *                  iframe to the user's dev server.
 *
 * The HTML the caller passes in may have any shape — full document,
 * fragment, no <head>. We handle the common cases:
 *   1. Has `<head>` → inject right after the opening tag
 *   2. Has `<html>` but no `<head>` → insert `<head>…</head>` right
 *      after `<html>`
 *   3. Bare fragment → wrap the input in a minimal `<!doctype html>
 *      <html><head>…</head><body>{input}</body></html>` shell

/**

 *
 * IMPORTANT (Phase 4 P1.3): CodePilot's CSP is ALWAYS injected, even
 * when the input HTML already contains a Content-Security-Policy
 * meta. Inline HTML from chat code fences and AI-generated artifacts
 * is untrusted content — an attacker who controls the HTML body
 * could otherwise include their own permissive CSP (e.g.
 * `default-src *`) to defeat the lockdown.
 *
 * CSP intersection semantics make multi-policy injection safe: when
 * multiple Content-Security-Policy directives are present, resources
 * must satisfy ALL of them, so adding our restrictive baseline can
 * only tighten, not loosen, the effective policy. The CodePilot
 * meta is injected at the FRONT of <head> so the browser sees it
 * before any other policy the document might carry.
