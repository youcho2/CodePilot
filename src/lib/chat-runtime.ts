/**
 * chat-runtime — server-side runtime resolver helpers (read DB
 * setting, walk the runtime registry, etc.).
 *
 * The **pure** pieces — `ChatRuntime` type, `ChatRuntimeParam` type,
 * `isChatRuntimeParam`, `chatRuntimeParamForSession` — live in
 * `chat-runtime-shared.ts` so client components can import them
 * without dragging Node-only deps (`async_hooks`, Sentry, etc.) into
 * the browser bundle. This file re-exports them so server callers
 * keep working unchanged.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from `runtime/registry`:
 *   `runtime/registry` returns the concrete agent runtime id used to
 *   spawn the SDK subprocess (`'claude-code-sdk'` / `'native'`). The chat
 *   picker / Models page / provider-resolver want a label that matches
 *   `ModelRuntimeCompat`'s `claude_code_compatible` / `codepilot_runtime_compatible`
 *   flags so filtering reads naturally. This module is the translation
 *   layer; everything else uses these labels.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - `/api/providers/models?runtime=auto`  — server resolves + filters
 *   - `provider-resolver.resolveProvider({ runtime })` — gates default-model
 *     selection alongside the existing hidden-id guard
 *   - `useProviderModels({ runtime: 'auto' })` — chat picker hook passes
 *     'auto' through and lets the server decide

// Import from `./runtime` (the barrel index), NOT `./runtime/registry`
// directly. The barrel performs `registerRuntime(nativeRuntime)` and
// `registerRuntime(sdkRuntime)` as import-time side effects; pulling
// resolveRuntime from `./runtime/registry` skips that registration and
// makes resolveRuntime() throw "No agent runtime registered" on any
// caller that hasn't already imported the barrel transitively.
//
// This bit `/api/providers/models?runtime=auto` (500 in dev): the route
// only imports chat-runtime, not the barrel, so the registry was empty
// when getActiveChatRuntime() fired. Routing every consumer through the
// barrel guarantees registration before resolution.

// must import directly from `chat-runtime-shared` (this file's

// bundle).

 * Phase 2 Step 2: session-aware variant of `getActiveChatRuntime`.
 *
 * If the session record carries a non-empty `runtime_pin`, that value
 * wins regardless of the current global `agent_runtime` setting — the
 * user's per-session commitment is a stronger signal than a global
 * default the user may have changed for unrelated reasons (e.g. they
 * connected a new provider in another chat).
 *
 * Empty / undefined / unknown pin → fall through to the global path
 * (`getActiveChatRuntime()`). This preserves the today-default
 * behavior for any session created before the column existed (every
 * legacy row has `runtime_pin = ''`) and for new chats the user
 * hasn't explicitly pinned.
 *
 * Step 3+ will plumb `session` into the chat send route and the
 * picker hook so they call this wrapper instead of the global one.
 * Today nothing reads it except the immunity tests — this is the
 * data-plane prerequisite that makes the migration possible.
