/**
 * sdk-subprocess-env.ts — Single-source-of-truth env builder for every SDK
 * subprocess spawn (main chat stream, generateTextViaSdk, provider-doctor
 * live probe, future callers).
 *
 * Why this exists: the per-request shadow `~/.claude/` (claude-home-shadow.ts)
 * implements the "provider-group ownership of credentials" rule. Multiple
 * code paths spawn the SDK, and every one of them must apply the same rule
 * — otherwise auxiliary requests (compression, doctor probes, sub-agent
 * delegations) silently bypass the shadow and pick up cc-switch credentials,
 * making the diagnostic and main flows disagree. See P2 reviews on
 * claude-client.ts:332 (`generateTextViaSdk`) and provider-doctor.ts:758
 * (`runLiveProbe`).
 *
 * Callers receive a `{ env, shadow }` pair and MUST call `shadow.cleanup()`
 * in a `finally` block. The cleanup is idempotent and a no-op when no
 * shadow was actually built (env-mode pass-through).

/**
 * Build the env that goes to the SDK subprocess for a resolved provider.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - When `resolved.provider` is set (explicit DB provider): builds a per-
 *   request shadow ~/.claude/ that strips ANTHROPIC_* keys from settings.json
 *   AND ~/.claude.json, while preserving every other user-level config
 *   (mcpServers, hooks, enabledPlugins, skills, agents, plugins, commands,
 *   CLAUDE.md, .credentials.json). HOME and USERPROFILE are pointed at the
 *   shadow root so the SDK's settings loader reads our stripped copies
 *   instead of the live ones.
 * - When `resolved.provider` is undefined (env mode / cc-switch path):
 *   returns a pass-through real-HOME setup. cc-switch settings.json supplies
 *   credentials normally.
 *
 * In both cases, the returned env has CodePilot's PATH expansion, Git Bash
 * detection (Windows), and the provider's auth/baseUrl/model env applied via
 * `toClaudeCodeEnv()`.
