/**
 * Harness built-in tool side-channel event bus — cross-runtime.
 *
 * Originally introduced in Phase 5c (2026-05-16) under
 * `src/lib/codex/proxy/builtin-event-bus.ts` solely for the Codex
 * provider proxy path: bridge tools executing inside `streamText` had
 * no Responses-API slot for "the proxy already handled this tool,
 * here's the MediaBlock CodePilot UI should render".
 *
 * Phase 5e Phase 0.5 P1 (2026-05-17, Native MediaBlock補齐) promotes
 * the bus to a cross-runtime harness primitive. The CodePilot Native
 * Runtime hits the same wall: `builtin-tools/media.ts` returns plain
 * text from `execute()` (ai-sdk feeds the literal return value back to
 * the model), but the chat UI needs a MediaBlock with a
 * `localPath` / `mediaId` to render the image card inline. Stuffing
 * the MediaBlock into the model-visible return value is ugly (model
 * sees a base64-bearing JSON blob). Side-channel emit + listener
 * splice keeps the model-visible text clean while the UI gets the
 * structured MediaBlock.
 *
 * Wire:
 *   1. Each runtime subscribes with its `sessionId` BEFORE issuing the
 *      first tool call so events from early steps don't get dropped.
 *      - Codex Runtime: `CodexRuntime.stream()` → `subscribeBuiltinEvents`
 *      - Native Runtime: `agent-loop.ts` → `subscribeBuiltinEvents`
 *   2. Built-in tool `execute()` emits a `tool_completed`
 *      `RuntimeRunEvent` (and optionally `tool_started` for long-
 *      running ops) carrying any `MediaBlock[]` via this bus.
 *   3. The runtime listener splices the MediaBlock into its SSE
 *      `tool_result` event (Native) or pipes the canonical event
 *      directly via `canonicalToSseLine` (Codex).
 *
 * Contract points:
 *
 *   - Emit-before-subscribe is dropped. We don't buffer because a
 *     stale buffer carries cross-turn risk (last turn's image leaking
 *     into next turn's UI). The runtime always subscribes first.
 *   - Each session has its own bucket; sessions are independent.
 *   - Listener errors are caught + logged so a misbehaving renderer
 *     subscriber can't take down a tool's `execute()` loop.
 *   - `globalThis`-attached so different Next.js module graphs
 *     (proxy API route vs runtime module in Electron) share state.
 *     A plain module-level Map would create two buses in dev when
 *     Next hot-reloads only one of them.
