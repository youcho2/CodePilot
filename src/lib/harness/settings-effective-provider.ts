/**
 * Settings effective provider resolver — Phase 5e Phase 3 review
 * round 4 fix P2 #2 (2026-05-18).
 *
 * Scope (narrowed 2026-05-18 review round 5 P2 — match implementation):
 *
 *   **Provider-level fallback only.** This helper resolves the
 *   effective PROVIDER id when the user's pinned provider id is
 *   missing / inactive — same chain `resolveProvider()` walks at
 *   chat send time (pinned → default_provider_id setting → active
 *   provider). It does NOT walk model-level fallback (model not in
 *   the catalog under the active Runtime, role-model overrides,
 *   etc.) — that lives in `resolveNewChatDefault()` on the client
 *   side and would require feeding full ProviderGroup data here.
 *
 *   Today the only downstream consumer is the **codex_runtime
 *   capability matrix downgrade**: when the resolved provider id is
 *   `codex_account`, bridge-only capabilities demote to
 *   perception_only. That decision is provider-level — `codex_account`
 *   is a virtual provider id, not a model id — so provider-level
 *   resolution is sufficient for the current Settings clipboard.
 *
 *   If a future feature needs "Settings capability matrix matches
 *   exact model the next chat will use", extend with model-level
 *   resolution by feeding ProviderGroup data + calling
 *   `resolveNewChatDefault()` from server-side. Until then the
 *   intentional scope is provider-level only.
 *
 * Tests live in `settings-effective-provider.test.ts` under the
 * "provider-level" describe blocks; model-level fallback is
 * explicitly out of scope there.
