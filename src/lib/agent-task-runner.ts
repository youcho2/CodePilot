/**
 * Phase 3 Step 4 — background Agent task runner.
 *
 * **Step 4a → 4b transition (now active in 4b)**:
 *
 *   - **4a delivered** the architectural shell — task-bound chat
 *     session creation / reuse, `task.source` branching, HEARTBEAT_OK
 *     silent contract, message persistence with `task_run_id`
 *     metadata, marker render path. Underlying model call was
 *     `generateTextFromProvider` (one-shot text, no tools, no
 *     permission events).
 *
 *   - **4b swaps the model call** to headless `streamClaude` via
 *     `runClaudeHeadless` (see `lib/headless-claude.ts`). Tasks now go
 *     through the same Runtime / Agent execution chain as interactive
 *     chat. Tool calls, file reads, permission requests are real;
 *     `waiting_for_permission` is reachable when the agent hits a
 *     permission gate while running headless. The runner's return
 *     signature is unchanged from 4a — the swap is local to the
 *     `// 4. Model call` block.
 *
 * `task.source` branching:
 *
 *   - `'user'` → task-bound session (`chat_sessions.source='task'`,
 *     hidden from main list). Headless streamClaude consumes the
 *     stream; `permission_request` → `status: 'waiting_for_permission'`
 *     with partial assistant text persisted; `scheduled_tasks.status`
 *     → `'paused'` so the scheduler doesn't refire.
 *
 *   - `'assistant_heartbeat'` → buddy session (lazy-created if the
 *     user toggles heartbeat on before opening the workspace). Same
 *     headless streamClaude path; HEARTBEAT_OK silent contract gates
 *     the assistant message + notification.
 *
 * **No durable resume** — the v2 plan's hard line. When the runner
 * sees `permission_request` it cancels the stream completely. The
 * partial assistant text is persisted with `task_run_id` metadata
 * so the user can see what the agent was thinking; choosing
 * "Re-run" starts a brand new run with a fresh runId from scratch.
 *
 * **Marker render contract** — every message persisted here carries
 * `metadata.task_run_id`. MessageList renders `<TaskRunMarker />`
 * before the first message of each run group. The marker is RENDER-
 * ONLY — `task_run_id` is never written into `message.content` and
 * never enters the LLM prompt context.

    //      or a manual repair) to point at a user-visible chat. After
    //      the origin_session_id fix, the runner would still trust
    //      that pointer and write the task's assistant message into
    //      the user's regular chat. Any pre-existing scheduled_tasks
    //      row with session_id pointing at a `source='user'` chat
    //      would silently keep the old behaviour forever.
    //
    //   2. /api/tasks/schedule still accepts session_id from the
    //      POST body. The schedule_task tool doesn't send it (we
    //      removed that), but a misconfigured external caller could
    //      still POST one and have the runner write into a
    //      user-visible chat.
    //

    // task-bound execution session, and fall through to the create
    // branch below (which will inherit from origin_session_id and
