/**
 * Codex app-server tracing noise control (B-025).
 *
 * A user's main log reached 12.5 GB; ~99% of the recent tail was Codex
 * app-server INFO span tracing — `codex_core::tasks: enter/exit` and
 * `codex_core::session::handlers: enter/exit` — tens of thousands of lines in
 * seconds. Two defenses, both pure + unit-testable:
 *
 *  1. `resolveCodexRustLog` — default the spawned app-server to `RUST_LOG=warn`
 *     so it doesn't EMIT the INFO flood at all; opt back in explicitly.
 *  2. `shouldDropCodexTraceLine` — a backstop on the stderr tee that drops those
 *     specific high-frequency INFO spans even if something re-enables info
 *     tracing (operator RUST_LOG, older binary). It NEVER drops warn / error /
 *     fatal lines, so fatal-config fail-fast and real diagnostics survive.
