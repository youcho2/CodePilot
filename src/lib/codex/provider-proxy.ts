/**
 * Codex provider-proxy injection helper.
 *
 * Phase 5 Phase 5 (2026-05-13). Builds the `config` override passed
 * to Codex `thread/start` so Codex resolves the user's targeted
 * CodePilot provider through our local proxy route instead of trying
 * to call the upstream API directly.
 *
 * Codex schema: `ThreadStartParams.config?: { [key: string]: JsonValue }`
 * is a free-form override map. The proxy injection sets:
 *
 *   config.model_providers = {
 *     codepilot_proxy: {
 *       name: 'CodePilot via Codex',
 *       base_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/codex/proxy/v1',
 *       wire_api: 'responses',
 *       http_headers: { 'x-codepilot-target-provider': '<provider-id>' },
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * The header is how the proxy route knows which CodePilot provider
 * the user picked. We use a header (not a query string) because
 * Codex's HTTP client adds them to every request to that provider
 * without needing per-request override plumbing.
 *
 * Phase 5b status: the proxy route is fully implemented for every
 * recognised compat tier via the unified translator at
 * `src/lib/codex/proxy/unified-adapter.ts`. CodexRuntime.stream()
 * threads provider id through to `buildCodexThreadStartParams`
 * below, so a non-codex_account provider's first message creates
 * a thread bound to the proxy injection; subsequent messages on the
 * same chat session resume that thread as long as the provider
 * binding still matches (mismatch detection in `runtime.ts`).

/**
 * Build the shared `cwd / modelProvider / config` payload that BOTH

 * `ThreadResumeParams` schema (codex-rs/.../v2/ThreadResumeParams.ts)
 * accepts `modelProvider`, `config`, and `cwd` exactly like
 * `ThreadStartParams`. Phase 5b previously passed these only on start
 * — the resume path inherited whatever the Codex server still had in
 * memory for the thread. That breaks when:
 *
 *   1. CodePilot's dev port changed between turns (proxy base_url is
 *      no longer valid in the cached config).
 *   2. The Codex app-server restarted between turns (in-memory thread
 *      metadata cleared; resume reload from disk may or may not
 *      include the codepilot_proxy entry depending on persistence).
 *   3. A future Codex version normalises thread state and prunes
 *      unknown model_providers across reloads.
 *
 * Always re-attaching the same payload on resume avoids all three
 * cases. Codex treats resume-time overrides as authoritative for the
 * resumed thread per the schema's "Configuration overrides for the
 * resumed thread" docstring.
 *
 *   - `'codex_account'` (virtual provider) → no injection. The thread
 *     uses Codex's own model_providers map keyed under its native
 *     OAuth account.
 *   - any non-empty non-`'env'` providerId → proxy injection so Codex
 *     routes upstream calls through `/api/codex/proxy/v1/responses`.
 *   - empty / `'env'` → caller MUST reject before reaching this fn;
 *     this is an unreachable contract violation that we surface as
 *     a thrown error rather than silently constructing a no-op.
 *
 * The return shape is intentionally a plain object the runtime
 * spreads into either `{ ...params }` (for thread/start) or
 * `{ threadId, ...params }` (for thread/resume).
