 * Tools that must be denied outright under `auto_review`.
 *
 * ## Why a deny rule, and not our `canUseTool` human-only branch
 *
 * `canUseTool` is NOT a pre-review interception under `permissionMode: 'auto'`.
 * Verified by reading the shipped classifier in
 * `node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/cli.js` (0.2.111), whose
 * permission entry point resolves in this order:
 *
 *   1. deny rules            → `{behavior:'deny'}` returned immediately, and
 *                              the auto branch is only entered for `'ask'`
 *                              ⇒ **deny rules run before the classifier**
 *   2. `requiresUserInteraction()` tools → returned as `'ask'` before the
 *                              classifier (this is what protects
 *                              `AskUserQuestion`, which declares it `true`)
 *   3. non-`classifierApprovable` safety checks → `'ask'`
 *   4. otherwise → **the model classifier decides, and an approval returns
 *      `{behavior:'allow'}` without ever prompting** — `canUseTool` is the
 *      prompt, so it is never called.
 *
 * Our MCP tools hit case 4: nothing in the SDK marks them interactive, so
 * under `'auto'` the classifier could approve `codepilot_generate_image`
 * (spends money) or `codepilot_notify` (leaves the machine) with no human in
 * the loop. The `PermissionRequest` hook is no help either — it is dispatched
 * only in the `shouldAvoidPermissionPrompts` branch, i.e. after the classifier
 * has already run.
 *
 * That leaves deny rules as the only interception the SDK actually offers, so
 * under `auto_review` these tools are unavailable rather than reviewable. The
 * tradeoff is deliberate and fail-closed: 替我审批 means "a model may approve
 * the routine things", never "a model may spend your money or publish for
 * you". `default` / `full_access` still expose the tools normally.
 *
 * `AskUserQuestion` is intentionally NOT here: the SDK already routes it to a
 * human, and denying it would break the model's ability to ask anything.
 *
 * ## Derived, not listed (review round #3, P1)
 *
 * The set is computed by running {@link getHumanOnlyCategory} over the whole
 * in-process tool universe, so *every* rule that makes a tool human-only —
 * explicit table, credential name marker, or `mutating_external` — reaches the
 * pre-classifier boundary. A hand-maintained list could (and did) agree with
 * the classifier by coincidence while leaving derived categories enforced only
 * in `canUseTool`, which under `'auto'` may never be called.
 *
 * ## Scope, and why that is now sound (review round #4, P1)
 *
 * Only CodePilot's own in-process servers can be enumerated at options-build
 * time — a **user-configured external MCP server** ships its tool list at
 * connect time, after these options are built, so `mcp__vault__read_secret`
 * could never appear in this list and the auto-mode classifier could approve it.
 *
 * The previous round shipped that as a caveat. It is now closed at a different
 * layer instead: {@link buildClaudePermissionQueryOptions} refuses `'auto'`
 * outright when any external MCP server could load for the turn (see
 * `external-mcp.ts`). So by the time this function runs under `'auto'`, the
 * in-process universe IS the whole MCP universe, and enumerating it is a
 * complete answer rather than a partial one.
