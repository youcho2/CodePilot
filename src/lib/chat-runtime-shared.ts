/**
 * chat-runtime-shared — pure types + helpers safe to import from
 * client components.
 *
 * Why this file exists separately from `chat-runtime.ts`:
 *
 *   `chat-runtime.ts` calls `resolveRuntime()` from `./runtime`, which
 *   transitively pulls in `runtime/sdk-runtime.ts → claude-client.ts`,
 *   and that module imports Node-only things (Sentry, OpenTelemetry,
 *   `child_process`, `fs`, `async_hooks`, …). Any client component
 *   that imports a value (not just a type) from `chat-runtime.ts`
 *   drags the whole server-side import graph into the client bundle
 *   and Next.js fails the build with `Module not found: Can't resolve
 *   'async_hooks'`.
 *
 *   So: the **pure** pieces (the type union + the type guard +
 *   `chatRuntimeParamForSession`) live here, with **zero** imports
 *   from `./runtime` or anything that touches a Node-only API. Client
 *   components import from `chat-runtime-shared`. Server-side callers
 *   keep importing from `chat-runtime` (which re-exports these names
 *   so existing call sites don't break).
 *
 *   Caught by Phase 2 Step 3b review (2026-05-07): a sandbox dev build
 *   threw at `ChatView.tsx → chat-runtime.ts → runtime/index.ts →
 *   sdk-runtime.ts → claude-client.ts → async_hooks`. Splitting the
 *   types/pure helpers off was the load-bearing fix.

/**
 * Phase 0.5 Slice E.1 (2026-05-13) — `ChatRuntime` is now an alias of
 * the canonical `RuntimeId` from `runtime/runtime-id.ts`. Adding a
 * new runtime (Codex / Gemini / …) goes through `RUNTIME_IDS` in
 * runtime-id.ts; every consumer of `ChatRuntime` automatically picks
 * it up. The legacy two-state union was Codex's P1 finding —
 * hand-rolled string-literal blocked Codex Runtime from being added
 * with a single-place edit.

/**
 * Phase 5 Phase 6 IA correction round 3 (2026-05-14) — translate the
 * stored `agent_runtime` setting (registry-id form) into the chat-side
 * `ChatRuntime` (canonical RuntimeId form) the chat composer's
 * `RuntimeSelector` consumes.
 *
 * Registry id ↔ chat-runtime label mapping:
 *
 *   'claude-code-sdk' → 'claude_code'        (legacy alias)
 *   'native'          → 'codepilot_runtime'  (legacy alias)
 *   'codex_runtime'   → 'codex_runtime'      (Phase 3 — identity)
 *
 * Unknown / 'auto' / null defaults to 'claude_code' so the trigger
 * never renders empty during the first-paint window.
 *
 * Why this exists: pre-round-3 the chat composer hard-coded a binary
 * ternary `=== 'claude-code-sdk' ? 'claude_code' : 'codepilot_runtime'`
 * at two callsites (chat/page.tsx + ChatView.tsx) that completely
 * dropped Codex Runtime. With `agent_runtime='codex_runtime'` stored,
 * the RuntimeSelector showed "Claude Code" while Models/Settings
 * already agreed Codex was the default — the IA-round-2 fix
 * propagated to server-side but the chat composer's translation was
 * stuck in two-engine days.
 *
 * Pure: same constraints as `chatRuntimeParamForSession`.

/**
 * Phase 6 P0 (2026-05-15) — resolve a session's effective ChatRuntime
 * to a CONCRETE RuntimeId, never 'auto'. This is the input the chat
 * composer / picker should use for per-row compat gating.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. If the session has a stored `runtime_pin` that's a known
 *      RuntimeId → use it verbatim.
 *   2. Otherwise consult the global `agent_runtime` setting via
 *      `agentRuntimeToChatRuntime` (which maps the legacy
 *      `claude-code-sdk` / `native` registry ids + the new
 *      `codex_runtime` to canonical chat-runtime labels).
 *
 * Why this is needed: `chatRuntimeParamForSession(runtimePin)` returns
 * `'auto'` when no session pin exists. That `'auto'` then flows into
 * `useProviderModels`, which treats `'auto'` as "no per-row gating
 * yet, follow the catalog". The picker then renders every model as
 * enabled — even under Codex Runtime where most providers can't yet
 * route through the (still-scaffolded) provider proxy. Resolving to a
 * concrete RuntimeId at the boundary closes that hole.
 *
 * Pure: no DB, no React, no Node-only deps. Safe to import from any
 * client component or server caller. Callers that need to know the
 * global runtime first should hook `useGlobalAgentRuntime` and pass
 * `state.agentRuntime` as the second arg.
