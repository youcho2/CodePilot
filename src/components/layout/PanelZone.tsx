/**
 * PanelZone — light right-rail container.
 *
 * Mounts:
 *   - FileTreePanel — independent topbar entry. The file tree is a
 *     high-frequency deterministic tool, kept out of the Workspace
 *     Sidebar so a quick file lookup doesn't drag the user into the
 *     full Tab shell.
 *   - AssistantPanel — assistant-workspace surface; doesn't fit the
 *     AI-work-surface Tab model, so it lives here as its own concern.
 *
 * The Git / Widget / Markdown / Artifact / file-preview surfaces all
 * live inside `<WorkspaceSidebar>` as fixed or dynamic Tabs and never
 * render here.
 *
 * v13 — FileTreePanel and the Workspace Sidebar are additive: both
 * can be open simultaneously and the chat area shrinks accordingly.
 * Each topbar toggle (UnifiedTopBar) flips its own panel only, with
 * no auto-close of the other. Earlier rounds (and v11) treated them
 * as mutually exclusive; that direction was reversed after the user
 * pointed out the actual product wish was coexistence — see the
 * Phase 3 archive's v13 entry for the full rationale.
 *
 * Phase 7c-D — width state for the file tree moved up here from
 * FileTreePanel so PanelZone can pass it to the new CardFrame's
 * `width` prop and pair it with a ResizeHandle sibling. FileTreePanel
 * now renders only the inner content (header + body).
