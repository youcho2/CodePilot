/**
 * agent-loop-anthropic-wire.test.ts — executable behavior test for the native
 * Agent Loop's Anthropic `providerOptions` wire shape (model plan Phase 2 / s05,
 * 2026-07-18).
 *
 * Codex review (round #1) flagged that s05 was only source-pinned: tests
 * asserted the sanitizer returned effort and that the source text mentioned
 * `anthropicOpts.effort`, but nothing ran the wire-construction path and
 * captured the object that reaches `streamText({ providerOptions })`.
 *
 * buildAnthropicProviderOptions is that exact construction path (agent-loop.ts
 * calls it and assigns its `.anthropic` straight to `providerOptions`). Feeding
 * it real sanitized options and asserting on the returned object IS asserting on
 * the real request shape. This covers the s05 contract: Sonnet 5 + xhigh on the
 * OFFICIAL Anthropic Native path sends providerOptions.anthropic.effort='xhigh'
 * with NO effort-ignored signal, while the third-party PROXY path drops it and
 * raises the drop signal (RUNTIME_EFFORT_IGNORED, keyed off effortDroppedForProxy).
