/**
 * v11 → v13 → round 7+ right-rail policy + layout history.
 *
 * Round 7+ (2026-05-23) note: ChatContentRow used to derive a
 * `railVisible = fileTreeOpen || ws?.state.open` flag and only paint
 * a `border-t` between the topbar and the work area when a rail was
 * actually visible. The macOS-vibrancy refresh wrapped the whole row
 * in a single rounded card with unconditional top/bottom borders, so
 * `railVisible` is dead and the assertion that used to pin it was
 * removed from this file. The "additive rails" invariants below are
 * still authoritative — only the conditional-border test went away.
 *
 * --- Original v11 → v13 history below ---
 *
 * v11 → v13 right-rail policy reversal.
 *
 * v11 added a `RightRailMutexEnforcer` and pinned both topbar
 * onClick handlers as auto-closing the OTHER panel — codifying the
 * idea that FileTreePanel and WorkspaceSidebar should be mutually
 * exclusive ("only one rail at a time so chat keeps breathing
 * room"). The user reviewed v11 and called the direction wrong: the
 * actual product wish is for the two panels to be **additive** —
 * users want to browse files in the FileTree AND keep a markdown /
 * artifact / file-preview Tab pinned on the WorkspaceSidebar at the
 * same time. Forcing one to close on the other's open path was
 * fixing the wrong invariant.
 *
 * v13 reverses:
 *   - `RightRailMutexEnforcer` component: removed entirely.
 *   - Topbar fileTree onClick: drops `if (next && ws.state.open)
 *     ws.setOpen(false)`. Each toggle now just flips its own state.
 *   - Topbar sidebar onClick: drops `if (next && fileTreeOpen)
 *     setFileTreeOpen(false)`. Same pattern.
 *   - The flexbox layout in `ChatContentRow` already supported both
 *     panels stacked on the right (they were rendered as siblings);
 *     only the behavior was wrong.
 *
 * This file kept the original `right-rail-mutex.test.ts` name so git
 * history is traceable, but the asserted invariant is now the
 * opposite: **the two panels can coexist, neither button closes the
 * other, no enforcer effect exists**. A future PR re-introducing
 * mutex would trip these assertions and force a re-read of the
 * v13 product decision.
